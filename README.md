# SPRING-BOOT-DEVTIRO

Here is the English translation:

**Author Book API** is a Spring Boot application that allows easy management of authors and their books.
It exposes REST endpoints to create, retrieve, update, and delete authors as well as their works.
Built with a clean and modular architecture, the API enables smooth integration with external applications and provides a solid foundation for developing a library or literary catalog management system.
